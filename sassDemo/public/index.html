                    As its title promises, this bried chapter establishes the era
                    in which the novel takes place: England and France in 1775. The
                    age is marked by competing and contradictory attitudes-"It was
                    the best of times, it was the worst of times"
                </p>

                    On a Friday night in late November of 1775, a mail
                    coach wends its way from London to Dover. The Journey
                    proves so treacherous that the three passengers must 
                    dismount from the carriage and hike alongside it as it
                    climbs a steep hill. From out of the great mists, a messenger
                    on horseback appears and asks to speak to Jarvis Lorry of
                    Tellson's Bank.
